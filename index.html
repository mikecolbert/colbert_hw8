        <h3>About Mike </h3>

        <p>
          I grew up in Bowling Green, a small farm town in northeast Missouri. I'm a 48-year-old father with two boys (ages 16 & 19) and one wife (so far). Amy and I have been together since high school, so I'm liking my odds :). I've lived in
          Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. I've been a grocery store carry-out, driven dump trucks and backhoes for a city street department, organized youth sports and other programs at a YMCA and summer camps, interned at a municipal
          recreation department, and graduated with a BS in Parks and Recreation Management with some computer courses. After graduation, I spent time as an EMT, a short time working as a community support person for people with mental illness, and 2
          weeks as a furniture salesman.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated in 1994 with a BS in Recreation Management. I began my IT career in 1998 at the St. Louis Public Library. I was sucked into the dot com bubble. I was hired to install computers after Bill Gates donated $1.2 million to the
          library for modernizing their technology. After a few weeks, my job duties expanded to include helping configure LAN and WAN networks, and I was introduced to computer and network security. I moved with Amy to Iowa City in August 1999 when
          she started the Ph.D. program in the Management and Organizations department at Tippie.
        </p>

        <p>
          After moving to Iowa City, I spent time working as a contractor doing phone tech support for McCleod USA salespeople. Within a few months, I landed at Kinze Manufacturing, where I worked for several years. I worked as a network and system
          administrator and was involved in several significant projects and system implementations. After her graduation in 2004, Amy started teaching at the University of Notre Dame. The first year in Indiana, I was a stay at home dad, and then I
          started teaching as an adjunct in Fall 2005 at the University of Notre Dame. In 2007 we landed back at the University of Iowa. Beginning in fall 2007, I started teaching as an adjunct lecturer in the Business Analytics department (formerly
          Management Sciences) here at Tippie. In Fall 2010, I moved to a full-time lecturer, and in spring 2019, I was promoted to Associate Professor of Practice. I'm currently working on my Master's in Software Development.
